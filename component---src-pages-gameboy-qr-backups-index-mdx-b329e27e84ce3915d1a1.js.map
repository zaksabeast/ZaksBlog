Naturally, I wanted to play with my new toy and needed to think of a homebrew to make.`}</p>\n    <p>{`January was shaping up to be a busy month for me (in fact, I'm writing this post over a month late), so I needed something quick and small. As a result, any type of game was out of the question, which left only utility type tools.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A common utility often provided by homebrew is a way to back up game saves. People love being able to store their saves on a computer for safe keeping in case something bad happens to their game or console. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/\"\n      }}>{`Checkpoint`}</a>{` is an excellent example of this. To use Checkpoint, someone puts a cartridge in their 3DS, runs Checkpoint from their SD card, and the cartridge save gets copied to the SD card.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is a little bit more difficult to do on a Gameboy. If the Gameboy runs homebrew from a cartridge, how can it run homebrew and read the save file from a game cart at the same time? Even if that was solved, where would it copy the save file to?`}</p>\n    <p>{`My idea was to write a tiny homebrew that could send a save over the Gameboy's serial port to something like a Teensy or Raspberry Pi. The homebrew would copy itself to the Gameboy's memory, then jump execution to its in-memory copy. At that point, the Gameboy would no longer be executing from the EZ-FLASH cartridge, so it could be replaced with a regular game. Once the game was inserted, a button could be pressed to start dumping the save.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The general concept seemed reasonable, and seemed like it could be tweaked to apply cheat codes to a game rather than backing up data.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Surely someone else had already thought of something similar to this. A quick google search brought me to a homebrew that uses this concept to dump the rom of a game cartridge - `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/Palmr/cart-dumper\"\n      }}>{`Palmr's cart-dumper`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`My hopes of a project were dashed...until two wanted features caught my attention:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Dump save files (what I was really interested in)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Dump via QR Code`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Pretty much every existing method to dump save data requires extra hardware. Dumping data with QR codes would provide a way to get game data without anything more than a single flash cart. This type of thing would make dumping Gameboy saves a lot more accessible to people.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Plus, the idea just sounded really cool.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I was going to get busy soon, so I was looking for a smaller project. Considering I knew very little about Gameboy homebrew and QR code encoding, this project was already shaping up to be fairly sizable. I decided my best course of action was to build a proof of concept, and maybe revisit this project in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Practicality`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This project had several challenges that I needed to overcome:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Writing a QR code encoder in z80 assembly (the Gameboy processor shares most of the z80's instructions)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Writing a small enough QR code encoder that it can fit in the Gameboy's limited memory`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Writing an external app that could capture multiple QR codes and revert them back to a save dump`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Before solving those, there was a bigger obstacle that might have made the whole project impractical to use.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Gameboy has a tiny screen, which means each QR code shown on a Gameboy can only hold a small amount of data.

I decided to assume an absolute best case scenario where each pixel on a Gameboy could represent a module of a QR code (a black or white square on a QR code). This was definitely stretching it, and probably wouldn't work, so if my practicality test failed with a best case scenario, there was no hope for a more realistic scenario.`}</p>\n    <p>{`QR codes are square, so 144x144 pixels was my limit. QR codes need a bit of padding, so 141x141 pixels was my potential max size.

The higher the error correction, the less data the QR code can hold. With the highest error correction, the smallest QR code can hold 7 bytes, which would take a Pokemon Silver save 4,688 QR codes. The lowest error correction would take 1,931 QR codes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While that might seem like a high number, I was actually encouraged. There's a community of Pokemon players who like to use the game's random number mechanics to get perfect, rare, special Pokemon without cheat devices. Many of these players manually advance the RNG with in-game mechanics until the RNG will produce the Pokemon they want. In the latest games, this comes in the form of \"Raid RNG\". For many people without special tools, less than 5,000 RNG advances is viewed as a worthy RNG.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If gamers are willing to continuously increment an RNG 5,000 times to get a single Pokemon, surely they would not mind scanning less QR codes to redeem their save data off of a console they otherwise wouldn't be able to back up.`}</p>\n    <p>{`On top of that, Gameboy games use a battery to persist save data, and the save data is lost once the battery runs dry. For anyone that somehow still has a working save (via replacement battery or magic), the limited time to immortalize their save is extra incentive to bear a few thousand QR codes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Even for a worst case scenario, this wasn't entirely unreasonable.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Starting a proof of concept`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I've read a decent amount of z80 assembly to reverse engineer Pokemon games, and I've written a little bit to patch Pokemon games, so I wasn't going in completely blind.
