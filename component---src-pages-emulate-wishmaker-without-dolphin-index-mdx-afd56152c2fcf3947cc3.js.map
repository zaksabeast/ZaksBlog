couldn't be obtained through the normal gameplay of a Gameboy Advance Pokemon game. Most of those Pokemon could only be obtained through time specific events, such as going to a live event, so they can no longer be obtained today.`}</p>\n    <p>{`One of the very few that is still obtainable is the Wishmaker Jirachi. The Wishmaker is obtained from a Gamecube disc that came with the preorder of Pokemon Colosseum.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The setup to get the Jirachi can be bit tedious. A player needs to dust off their old Gamecube, find a Gameboy Advance to Gamecube link cable, hope their Colosseum bonus disc still works, etc.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this case, emulators are even more tedious to set up. Connecting a Gamecube and Gameboy Advance emulator is a very niche use case that is finnicky at best and often doesn't work. Besides that, many people don't have a computer strong enough to run a Gamecube emulator.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There's a specific Pokemon community that enjoys manipulating the random number generation in Pokemon games for challenging gameplay with extra rewards. They'll often use emulators for the extra benefits emulators can provide, so the difficulties of getting a Wishmaker Jirachi on an emulator is a bit of a pain point.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Since I was already digging into how the Wishmaker multiboot rom worked to build a portable Wishmaker distributor, I figured I would do one other Wishmaker project: get Wishmaker to run on a Gameboy Advance emulator without a Gamecube emulator.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In my last post, I described how the logic of creating and saving a Jirachi happens on the Gameboy Advance and how the Gamecube is purely used to put the Wishmaker multiboot rom on the Gameboy Advance. If the multiboot rom is loaded directly into an emulator, a Gamecube emulator should be completely uncessary.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Ideally a user should only need:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`A Gameboy Advance emulator`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The Wishmaker multiboot rom`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The save file of a Pokemon game they want Jirachi added to`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`Why am I writing this?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This patch didn't take long to make. In fact, I spent significantly more time writing this blog post than I did writing the patch.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I'm writing this because there's a decent amount of discovery that goes into reverse engineering software, a process most people never see or hear about, and recently I've wanted to share these adventures more often.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Entire books could be written about reverse engineering small fragments of code, so this post is barely going to scratch the tip of the iceberg.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Because this post is going to be pretty lengthy already, I'm only going to focus on the Jirachi mechanics and won't be talking about the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.serebii.net/rubysapphire/berryglitch.shtml\"\n      }}>{`berry glitch`}</a>{` mechanics.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Loading a Pokemon save`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Normally the Wishmaker rom expects a cartridge inserted into the Gameboy Advance so it can access the save file on the cartridge.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To an emulator, the game and save normally found on the cartridge can be two completely separate pieces of data, so the emulator should be able to load a Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire save without a Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire game.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When an emulator loads a game, it usually loads a save file with the same name, but with a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`.sav`}</inlineCode>{` extension. For example, if the Wishmaker multiboot rom is called `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`wishmaker.bin`}</inlineCode>{`, then most emulators will try to load `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`wishmaker.sav`}</inlineCode>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Using the method described in my last blog post, I had already extracted the Wishmaker multiboot rom. From there, I used my Wii with `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/FIX94/gba-link-cable-dumper\"\n      }}>{`gba-link-cable-dumper`}</a>{` to extract a save file from a Pokemon Ruby cartridge.`}</p>\n    <p>{`By naming the Ruby save to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`wishmaker.sav`}</inlineCode>{`, the emulator loaded my Pokemon Ruby save as if it was coming from an inserted cartridge.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Incompatible games`}</h2>\n    <p>{`It's widely known the Wishmaker Jirachi can only be sent to two games: Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. It would be a big problem if Wishmaker tried to overwrite data for a completely different game by mistake.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Because Wishmaker checks to make sure the inserted game is Pokemon Ruby or Sapphire, but the rom running on the emulator is Wishmaker, I needed to find where Wishmaker checks the inserted cartridge and patch it to think a valid cartridge is always inserted.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Finding the game check`}</h2>\n    <p>{`One of the initial Wishmaker routines `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`very`}</em>{` roughly looks like:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-cpp\"\n      }}>{`// Called from the main loop\nvoid runApp() {\n  setUpGraphics();\n\n  gamecubeHandshake();\n\n  u32 result = transferJirachiAndFixBerryGlitch();\n\n  switch (result) {\n    case 0:\n      printSuccessToUser();\n      break;\n    // Handle error cases and send errors to Gamecube\n  }\n\n  freezeExectution();\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p><inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`transferJirachiAndFixBerryGlitch`}</inlineCode>{` does a few things:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Transfers the Jirachi`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Updates save checksums`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Prints Jirachi transfer errors to the user`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`That last thing was particularly helpful.
