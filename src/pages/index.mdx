# Welcome to my blog

I love building things and learning from what other people have built.

Mark Rober said the thing he loves about being an engineer is, "if you have an idea about a thing, and that thing doesn't exist, you can just will it into existance". Yeah, it's a pretty amazing feeling.

I've done lots of fun things, but barely share any of it with other people. When I do, I'm asked why I don't give more talks and write about what I do in my spare time.

This blog is an effort to share some of the fun things I do outside of work.
